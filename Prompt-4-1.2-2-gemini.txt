You are a senior QA engineer. Review the provided Bash script against the requirements below.
Return:
1) An RTM table (REQ -> PASS/FAIL + evidence).
2) A concrete manual test plan (commands + expected outputs) for Linux (Debian/RaspiOS), macOS, and WSL.
3) A strict PASS/FAIL verdict.
If FAIL, provide minimal patch suggestions as unified diff snippets (do NOT rewrite the whole script).

REQUIREMENTS (must be checked):
- File header includes: # VERSION: 1.2.0
- Bash 3.2 compatible (no ${var,,}, no assoc arrays)
- Flags: -c/-w/-n and long flags, long flags case-insensitive, max 3 flags, unknown -> exit 2
- -n must produce 0 bytes stdout/stderr; logs go to ${AEON_ROOT}/logfiles; /tmp only early fallback with migration
- AEON_ROOT: /opt/aeon for Linux/WSL, /usr/local/aeon for macOS
- Ensures/installs deps: curl or wget, ca-certificates, git; plus python/venv/pip per OS; brew never as root
- Linux Docker install best-practice; docker daemon usability check; auto mode; docker failure -> native fallback
- Creates aeon-system non-login user; sets ownership of AEON_ROOT; sudoers file /etc/sudoers.d/aeon-system 0440 with visudo validation; sudoers commands declared via variables
- CRITICAL: clones repo to ${AEON_ROOT}/tmp/repo and copies needed runtime assets from repo into live tree (library + manifest files) instead of raw downloading
- Runs orchestrator as aeon-system, passes forwarded flags and:
  --file:/manifest/manifest.install.json --config:/manifest/config/manifest.config.cursed.json
- Exit codes: 0 success, 1 fail, 2 usage error

Now review the script.
