QA install.bash.v7.1.sh with RTM + PASS/FAIL.

Must validate:
- setup_logging is actually called (non-silent uses tee after detect_os)
- silent -n: 0 bytes stdout/stderr even on early failures
- logs migrate to ${AEON_ROOT}/logfiles (not stuck in /tmp)
- docker mode mounts /aeon + workdir + AEON_ROOT env + correct orchestrator path
- docker fallback works
- macOS brew never root
- bash 3.2 compatibility

Provide: exact line refs + minimal patch if anything fails.
